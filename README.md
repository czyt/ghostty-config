> [!NOTE]

Ghostty config is a beautiful configuration generator for [Ghostty Terminal](https://github.com/ghostty-org). Features include easily modifiable settings, a font playground, and tons of previews and demos for cursors, selections, and even the color palette. More features are soon to come including keybind validation.

This is a web tool that is deployed automatically via GitHub actions on every push to `main` to ensure it stays up to date. You can view and share the latest version at this url: [ghostty.zerebos.com](https://ghostty.zerebos.com/). Since this is meant to be used in tandem with the desktop Ghostty terminal, it does not do well on mobile and there really is no plan for that. As for desktop, if there is enough demand for it, I may make an alternate version of the tool optimized for desktop available via [Wails](https://wails.io/)!
